      "body": "In April, Vinnie asked for an interaction model which doesn't require a Verifier.  This is for things like SGX where the provable identity of the MRSIGNER is sufficient to the Relying Party.  The specific comment was: The question then is whether we need some form of time interval tracking between Verifiers A & B.  I believe it to be useful to understand the delta in time between the creation of the original Attestation Results, and their receipt on the Relying Party.  The one time I can think of when this might *not* be necessary is when the Relying Party trusts that the Attester cannot be meaningfully changed from the outside over time.  (E.g., a specific MRENCLAVE can expose no changing Evidence to Verifier A over time, and this MRENCLAVE is trusted to be unable to mimic another MRENCLAVE or replay Attestation Evidence about another MRENCLAVE.)  In such a case, nonce#2 from figure 1 can be safely dropped.   I will propose text to this effect into the draft.",

      "body": "Ned asserts that specific wording appears to conflict with other adopted drafts.  E.g., Section 2.1 \u2013 Non-reputable Identity Evidence and subsequent use of \u2018non-reputable\u2019 in the context of identifying the Attester or an Attesting Environment. Given a DAA key as Attesting Environment identity, the objective is to allow reputable Attester instance identity but non-reputable Attester class identity. Eric responded that in DAA, perhaps the term DAA credential should be formally defined.  What DAA says now is \"Attestation Evidence SHOULD be cryptographically associated with an identity document that is a randomised DAA credential.\" Additionally, perhaps the \"Attester Identity ('attesterIdentity')\"  principle in Section 5 should be refined to \"Anonymous Attester Identity\"?   In any case, DAA seems to have a more narrow definition of identity than draft-voit-rats-attestation-results.  In this draft, the non-reputable class itself be considered a form of identity.  So I think the *intent* of both sets of text don't conflict, even if we don't have all the terms right.  Also draft-voit-rats-attestation-results could easily import terms like \"Anonymous Attester Identity\" from DAA as being a valid form of identity.  Having the group being identified is quite useful.",
